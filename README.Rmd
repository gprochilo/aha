The aha package is a set of statistical analysis and teaching tools written by Guy A. Prochilo. Many of these tools have been written to implement a parameter estimation approach to planning research and analyzing data. These tools also serve a teaching purpose, and can be used to clarify introductory statistical concepts. The aha package is named after the interjection 'aha!', which refers to the human experience of understanding a previously incomprehensible problem or concept.

The aha package currently only contains one function: `ci.es`.

## Installation

<!-- You can install the released version of aha from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- install.packages("aha") -->
<!-- ``` -->

You can install the development version of aha from [GitHub](https://github.com/gprochilo) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("gprochilo/aha")
```
## Example

The `ci.es` function computes a confidence interval (CI) and confidence interval half-width (i.e., margin-of-error; hereby: _MoE_) for Cohen's _d_~z~, Cohen's _d_~s~, or Pearson's _r_. The CI for Cohen's _d_~z~ and Cohen's _d_~s~ is computed using an exact method based on the noncentral t distribution. The CI for Pearson's _r_ is computed using Fisher's transformation. It also returns _t_ and _p_ values for each combination of effect size and sample size. 

```{r eval=TRUE}
library(aha)
ci.es(es = 0.6, N = 20, effect = "dz", conf = 0.95)
```

<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->

<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub! -->
