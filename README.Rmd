The aha package is a set of statistical analysis and teaching tools written by Guy A. Prochilo. These tools primarily serve a teaching purpose, and can be used to clarify introductory statistical concepts. The aha package is named after the interjection 'aha!', which refers to the human experience of understanding a previously incomprehensible problem or concept.

The aha package currently only contains one function: `ci.pearson.r`.

## Installation

<!-- You can install the released version of aha from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- install.packages("aha") -->
<!-- ``` -->

You can install the development version of aha from [GitHub](https://github.com/gprochilo) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("gprochilo/aha")
```
## Example

The `ci.pearson.r` function computes a confidence interval (CI) and confidence interval half-width (i.e., margin-of-error; hereby: _MoE_) for the population Pearson's correlation coefficient based on summary reports of data. For completeness, it also computes the exact _t_ value and _p_ value for a given combination of correlation magnitude (_r_) and sample size (_N_). This is useful if the reporting publication has not included these values.

_Note_: this function assumes the sample data are outlier free and have a bivariate normal distribution. Ensure that these assumptions match those of the reporting publication.

```{r eval=TRUE}
library(aha)
ci.pearson.r(r = 0.49, n = 17, alternative = "two.sided")
```

<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->

<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub! -->
