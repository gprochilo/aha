The aha package is a set of statistical analysis and teaching tools that can be used to clarify introductory statistical concepts. The aha package is named after the interjection 'aha!', which refers to the human experience of understanding a previously incomprehensible problem or concept.

The aha package currently contains one function: `r_ci`.

## Installation

<!-- You can install the released version of aha from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- install.packages("aha") -->
<!-- ``` -->

You can install the development version of aha from [GitHub](https://github.com/gprochilo) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("gprochilo/aha")
```
## Example

The `r_ci` function computes a confidence interval (CI) and confidence interval half-width (i.e., margin-of-error; hereby: _MoE_) for the population Pearson's correlation coefficient (_r_) based on summary reports of data. If the _MoE_ is greater than half the size of _r_ the function will alert you that this _r_ may have been estimated with low precision. 

For completeness, the function also computes the exact _t_ value and _p_ value for a given combination of _r_ and sample size (_N_). This is useful if the summary report has not included these values. This function also supports non-zero null values. If a non-zero null value is selected, the resulting test is a _z_ test.

*Important note*: this function assumes the sample data are outlier free and have a bivariate normal distribution. Ensure that these assumptions match those of the reporting publication. There will also be a small loss of precision when using summary data to compute confidence intervals and test statistics. For example, if you input an *r* value that has been rounded to two decimal places, the *t* and *p* values may be slightly different from the true values. These differences, however, will be relatively minor.

### Alternative hypothesis: the true correlation is not equal to 0

```{r eval=TRUE}
# library(aha)
# aha::r_ci(r = 0.49, n = 17, conf_level = 0.95)
```

# Warning

This package is under development. Backwards compatibility is __not guaranteed__, and both functions and syntax may be __subject to change__ (or completely removed) in future updates. Exercise extreme caution if you choose to use this package within an analysis pipeline.
